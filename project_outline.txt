To-do for the Chess Project

For the main game logic

-define board representation (numpy array?)
-load a board state from a FEN string
-figure out how "moves" will be defined
-define a "movePiece" function that creates a new board state given a "move"
-define a "capture" function used by "movePiece" to determine whether or not a given move results in a capture
-define allowable moves for each piece
-define "check" and "checkmate" in some kind of "checkForCheckmate" function
-define other rules like en passante, castling, pawn swaps, etc.

For the AI

-figure out the heuristic(s) to create an evaluation function for a given board. 
-implement the minimax algorithm
-implement AB pruning

For the UI

-first, set up a basic command line GUI 
-once a viable amount of the game has been made, (perhaps once players can move pieces), set up the pygame GUI so that pieces can be moved via the GUI
-next, highlight squares where the players can legally move pieces
-finally, create some kind of way to display messages to the user such as "you win" or "check" or "checkmate"

Additional Features

-See where you're at, and do what you can do. If there's extra time, try implementing the heuristic/AI a different way, or adding some extra GUI features.  
-Maybe the heuristic function could make use of a neural network/self-play?  See what is out there
